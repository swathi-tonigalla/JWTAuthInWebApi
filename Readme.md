# Code base for JWT Auth series

This is the example codebase for my [YouTube series - JWT Auth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph8ddTRQ0eo&list=PLxWo8vu0UTZ2wXMBepa6DUGepJJJoBiUf), and a project of <https://www.codewithsaar.net>.

## Branches

There are 4 branches for different topic:

1. main - [JWT Authentication Overview](https://youtu.be/Ph8ddTRQ0eo)
1. roles - [Role Based Authorization](https://youtu.be/vMJZD3ls7Hc)
1. roles - [Role Based Authorization](https://youtu.be/vMJZD3ls7Hc)
1. refresh-token - [Easy & Secure: Add Refresh token in .NET (C#) WebAPI with JWT Authentication](https://youtu.be/TWBXiCS0RYM)

Code will be updated every once a while.

## Notes

All the code are not mostly optimized for OO principals to compensate the need of making points and demo. For example, you will see duplications as well as some times putting multiple class in same file. Those aren't best practices.
